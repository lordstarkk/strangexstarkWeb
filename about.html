            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My programming journey began with Python, which I learned as my first language. Over time, I expanded my skills and delved into web development, where I picked up the knowledge to create dynamic websites and applications. Now, I’m eager to dive into C++ to broaden my understanding of programming even further. I’ve also developed a deep interest in IoT projects, particularly using Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico. I enjoy creating innovative solutions that connect the digital and physical worlds.</p>
            <p>On top of that, I am a huge fan of Iron Man and Marvel movies, which has inspired me to use the name "strangexstark." This name is a nod to Iron Man and represents my admiration for the character and the tech-oriented universe of Marvel. In fact, I’ve built my own AI system, Jarvis, to serve as an intelligent assistant, much like Tony Stark’s iconic AI. This project is a testament to my passion for technology and my desire to create something that merges both my tech interests and love for Marvel.

            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a football player, and my favorite team is Real Madrid. Football is something I'm really passionate about, and I enjoy playing the game whenever I can. Being part of a team has taught me a lot about collaboration, strategy, and working towards a common goal, which are also values that I try to apply in my programming and tech projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this journey, I’ve realized that programming is not just about writing code—it's about problem-solving and creating solutions that can have a tangible impact. With each new project, I learn more about the endless possibilities that technology offers, and I am excited to continue exploring new areas in software development, AI, and IoT.
