                <h3>My learning journey Through Python</h3>
                <p>This is a repository, a reflection of my journey as a beginner programmer learning Python. It contains a collection of small, beginner-friendly projects I’ve built to understand Python programming and its applications. Each project serves as a milestone in my learning process, helping me solidify the fundamentals and gain hands-on coding experience. Alongside coding, I’m also learning version control with Git and exploring how to collaborate and showcase my work effectively on GitHub. This repository not only tracks my progress but also serves as a resource for others who might be starting their own Python journey.
